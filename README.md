# RandomForestClassifier for star's

01/2021


Developed through Google Colab for Astrophysics III classes

During class we've developed a scipt based on training data (1st part) which purpose was to determine best classifier for our dataset (2nd part).
After this we've chosen Random Forest Classifier to predict the class of a star based on 16 color comparisons for that object.
Training data was split to training and testing data in 75%-25% ratio.

Then for the best classifier (which was Random Forest Classifier) we've predicted a class of 169 objects.
Class B - Be Star
Class S - Main Sequence Star
Class Y - Young Stellar Object
Class E -
